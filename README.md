hello_world is a self starting flask application to help the user get
familiarized with the idea of flask.

super_hello_world incorporates the idea of routes, templates, and __init__
to create a basic and more rounded perspective of flask.

super_duper_hello_world is supposed to show the user the idea of forms,
flashing messages to the screen, and get/post methods using flask to
get user input.

Play around with flask! it's a great way to understand and get your foot
into web development!.
